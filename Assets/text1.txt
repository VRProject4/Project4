Child: I just finished my homework!
You: Great job! Now let's see what you should get for all your hard work.
Pick up either the cake or toy car with x and then bring it to your child.
You: Here's your favorite toy!
Child: Wow, thanks!
You: I've also made a healthy snack, so go eat at the table. I'll come and eat with you.
Child: Okay.
You: I just made chocolate cake!
Child: Wow, thanks!
You: I'm also made a healthy snack, so go eat at the table. I'll come and eat with you.
Child: Okay.
You: What's wrong?
Child: I don't like these.
Bring the snacks to the child to make them eat it, or the book to have them read instead.
You: Alright, go read this book then.
Child: Yay, thanks for not making me eat those snacks!
You: Too bad, you have to eat them. They're good for you.
Child: Aww...
Child: Hey! I'm feeling good today. Take me to the park? Let's go for a jog.
Allowing children freedom of choice (within limits) between foods has been shown to be associated with choosing healthier foods later in life. 
Additionally, rewarding good behavior with non-food items such as toys or activities helps prevents unhealthy food-reward pairings.
Child: You're taking me to the park today? Fine. Let's just walk for a bit.
Punishing eating behaviours can cause an increased aversion to the disliked dish which has shown foods with high calorie content and low nutritional value. 
For example, forcing a child to remain at the dinner table until their food is finished causes unconscious aversion to the healthy me.
Child: Do we have to go to the park today? I'm not feeling well.
Rewarding good behaviour with food can cause unhealthy eating habits later in life due to behaviour-reward pairing.
